# 04 Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

AS A coding boot camp student </br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores</br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers</br>

## User Story

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz </br>
WHEN I click the start button</br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question</br>
WHEN I answer a question</br>
THEN I am presented with another question</br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly</br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock</br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0</br>
THEN the game is over</br>
WHEN the game is over</br>
THEN I can save my initials and score</br>
